# TODOasIssue
From a list of TODOs to a list of issues on your GitHub.

```
#(1)[]: "This is my first TODO"
#(2)[]: "This is my second TODO"
```

## Installation
Soon.

## How `TODOasIssue` works?
GitHub projects can have issues created by developers / users to report errors, bugs and etcetera. The idea of building `TODOasIssue` is to automate the creation of issues locally by writing everything that you need in a simple text file and publishing it to your GitHub project without even opening your browser to do that.

## Project structure

- `lexer.go`: Convert text file to a list of tokens
- `parser.go`: From a list of tokens, build a list of TODOs
